<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
E-Commerce Back End Demo

![Project e-commerce back end Demo](e-commerce.gif)

This project was about creating a back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Additionally, this is a great way to test for RESTful CRUD operations. I selected to use Postman instead of Insominia. These work the same.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- [x] WHEN I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file
      THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- [x] WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
      THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- [x] WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
      THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
- [x] WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
      THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- [x] WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman
      THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
